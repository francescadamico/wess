<h2>Possibilities & Ideas</h2>
<div class="align-justify">
    <ul>
        <li>Comparisons with MASC measurements though the boundary layer. </li>
        <li>Comparison of flux gradient method with eddy covariance method. Further, compare the methods depending on the different soil types. Especially investigate if flux measurement errors depend on the moisture content in the surface. </li>
        <li>Use the ground station as surface flux measurements to scale MASC flux measurements in the morning/afternoon transition at different heights in the boundary layer.</li> 
    </ul>
    <strong>This list would be ideal for student project-seminar research:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>average and variability of atmospheric measurements;</li>
        <li>comparison of flux gradient method with eddy covariance method;</li>
        <li>make some NIR imagery with UAV and compare to surface fluxes at different test sites.</li> 
    </ul>
