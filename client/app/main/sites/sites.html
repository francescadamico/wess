<h2>The Ammer Valley Sites</h2>
<p class="align-justify">
    <strong>Entringen:</strong> <br> 
    Entringen site is at one of the wellheads for the Ammerbuch water supply. The immediate surroundings are grass which is enclosed by a fence.
<br>
Because this site is enclosed by a fence, it was chosen as the field comparison site. It is the location where all atmospheric stations were initially placed during summer 2013, in order to check their operation in a field environment. To date there are still three stations in this site, whereas the other two have been moved to Poltringen and Tailfingen. <br>
    This site is the closest and easiest to access site from the University of TÃ¼bingen.

<p class="align-justify">
    <strong>Poltringen:</strong> <br>
    This sits about 35-40 m above the Ammer River, on a flat region in the middle of the Ammer Valley. It is located next to a glider and private aircraft field to the west, and the town of Poltringen is to the south.
<br>
This site was the first to have sub-surface instrumentation installed, and therefore served as a test site. It was found that digging large pits in the soil, in order to install the instruments, resulted in un acceptable soil disturbance. 
<br>
Since installation this site has been covered with clover.

<p class="align-justify">
    <strong>Tailfingen:</strong> <br>
    In Tailfingen, in addition to the instruments present in the other sites, there is an Eddy Covariance station to measure fluxes of momentum, temperature, water vapor, and carbon dioxide.
