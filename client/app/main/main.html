<h2>The Ammertal Network</h2>
<p>The Ammer Valley Surface Measurement Network is a project funded by WESS though a grant from the DFG. <br>
    This project is an interdisciplinary effort to monitor near-surface conditions in the Ammer Valley just west of Tübingen. <br>
    230 instruments, with 620 data channels (!) have been installed in three different sites, the locations of which were chosen for their soil type and land usage, to form a representative group for the Ammer Valley. <br>
    The measurements are of sub-surface temperature and moisture, at 5 levels to a maximum depth of 1.5 m, at the surface, rain, soil heat flux and sunlight. The atmosphere is then measured at two levels for temperature, humidity, wind speed and wind direction.<br>
    The initial goal of this project was to provide surface data to validate models of soil water. Since its inception the goal has expanded to include measurements of interest for plant growth, surface-energy balance and energy fluxes in the surface layer of the atmosphere. </p>
